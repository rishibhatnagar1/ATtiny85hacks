# ATtiny85hacks

Using the Attiny85 board from daflabs, here is the link: http://daflabs.com/tinyboard-attiny85-development-board.html 

I am using an Arduino Uno to program it via ISP, here I will keep a repo of all the sensor intergrations I am working with. 

#There are a bunch of issue that come across while trying to upload the code.

I will keep a list of problems and there solutions here.
